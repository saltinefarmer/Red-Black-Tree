# Red Black Tree

## What This Project is
This red black tree was an assignment for my Algorithms course. This assignment was mean to draw out various skills. It entices the programmer to be thorough and cautious with their work, as the slightest mistake can ripple through such a complex data structure. It requires seasoned bug testing skills, and the ability to decide what helper methods are required to bring the code to life.

## Involved Parties
I created redblacktree.py from scratch in accordance to stipulations enacted by Dr. Adam A. Smith. Supporting files for the assignment (not included here) were provided by Dr. Smith to aid testing purposes.

## References
The textbook used for this course was Algorithms(4th Edition), authored by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## Instructions
This code does not require any additional files or packages to be run. However, it has no main method, and will not produce anything of value if run independently. It is designed to be utilized by programs in other files.
